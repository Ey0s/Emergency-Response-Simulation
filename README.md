# Emergency Response Simulation

## Overview
The **Emergency Response Simulation** is a console-based simulation built in **C#**. The application simulates a system where emergency units (Police, Fire Engine, and Ambulance) respond to various types of incidents, such as fires, crimes, and medical emergencies, in different locations within **Addis Ababa**. The simulation runs through multiple rounds where the user is required to choose how incidents are generated, and the system will assign the appropriate emergency units to handle each scenario. The goal is to efficiently manage and respond to emergencies, scoring points based on successful responses.

## Key Features
- **Multiple Emergency Units**: Includes **Police**, **Fire Engine**, and **Ambulance**.
- **Various Incident Types**: Fire, Crime, and Medical emergencies.
- **Addis Ababa Locations**: The incidents occur in popular locations in Addis Ababa, such as **Piassa**, **Bole**, **Lideta**, and more.
- **Incident Generation Options**: The user can generate incidents randomly or create custom incidents.
- **Scoring System**: Points are awarded for correct responses, and penalties are applied for incorrect responses.
  
## Requirements
- **.NET Framework** or **.NET Core** (for running C# applications)
- Basic understanding of **C#** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts

## How to Run the Simulation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in **Visual Studio** or any C# compatible IDE.
3. Build the solution.
4. Run the application to start the simulation in the console window.
5. Follow the prompts to generate incidents and manage the emergency response.
